This package contains code for drawing "roulettes" which are
mathematical curves created when one shape is rolled against another
and we trace a location relative to the curve as it rolls (think
spirographs).

The code contains:
    - roulette1  -- draws roulettes of specified curve when rolled along the x-axis
    - roulette2  -- draws roulettes of one curve rolled against another

In each of these cases curves are specified by a two functions: 
    - one takes a parameters t (or vector of parameters) and returns
      the appropriate [x,y] Cartesian coordinates along the curve.
    - the other returns the derivatives [dx/dt, dy/dt] at the same
      points 
There are several examples of such functions in the packages
    - ellipse and ellipsed (which can do a circle as a special case)
    - hyperbola and hyperbolad
    - parabola and parabolad

There are also several precalculated roulettes to use as test
functions
    - unuldary gives the roulette of an ellipse
    - nodary gives the roulette of a hyperbola, NB: there are two
      modes for this: one does the actual roulette, and ther other
      draws the curve known as the nodary, which is a concatenation of
      the roulettes
    - catenary gives the roulette of a parabola

There is one function defined to help in calculations
    - arclength numerically calculates arclengths along curves
      in whatever parameterisation is being used

There are a couple of test scripts, which also provide some examples
of how to use the code:
   - arclength_test: provides tests of the arclength code
   - roulette1_test: shows a selection of standard roulettes both
                     calculated using roulette1, and using the
		     theoretical curve 
   - roulette2_test:

% EPICYCLOID draws an epicycloid (the results of rolling one circle around another)
%     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycloid
%     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitrochoid
%
% INPUTS:
%              R = radius of the stationary circle
%              r = radius of the rolling circle
%           phi0 = starting point of contact as an angle WRT to the x-axis
%          theta = Nx1 vector of angles giving how far the outer circle has rolled
% 
% OUTPUTS:        
%         [x,y] = points on the epicycloid
%                 each is Nx1 vector
%             k = R/r
%                 if k is rational, e.g. p/q for integers p, q, then you get interesting curves
%
% Special cases include
%    Cardiod: R=r

- complete tests
  - make them all more rigorous
  - include arclength calculations in each of the curves provided
      to use as a test, not in the actual roulette calculations
  - do nice plots for all tests
      -limited number of rotated objects
      -overlapping curves

- put in autotests to look for the elliptic integrals
  and replace with numeric (quad) routines if not available

- do some animations

- do roulettes between two curves
   - add epicycloid, etc.
   - inside v outside?

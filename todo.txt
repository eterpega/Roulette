- complete tests
  - make the roulette tests nicer
      - have done ellipse/undulary
      - need to do hyperbola, parabola, and cycloids
      - would be nice to have a common harness for all of them?
        - just give three functions
	    - the rolled curve
	    - its derivatives
	    - its roulette function
	    - and some parameters
      - same with arclengths
            - see below      

  - include arclength calculations in each of the curves provided
      to use as a test, not in the actual roulette calculations
       ???
  - do nice plots for all tests
      -limited number of rotated objects
      -overlapping curves

- put in autotests to look for the elliptic integrals
  and replace with numeric (quad) routines if not available

- do nice views
   - some plots
   - some animations
